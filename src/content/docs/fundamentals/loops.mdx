Suppose you need a piece of code to execute multiple times. You could copy and paste it repeatedly, but this approach is impractical and reduces code readability. This is where loops become handy. They enable you to execute the same block of code multiple times, facilitating automation and efficient management of repetitive tasks.

## For loops

The <code>for</code> loop is utilized for iterating over a sequence, such as an array or the characters in a string. It provides a concise way to repeat a block of code multiple times.<p>Here's the basic syntax of the <code>for</code> loop:</p>

```javascript
for (initialization; condition; updation) {
  // code to be executed in each iteration
}
```

- <u>Initialization</u>: It is executed before the loop starts. It is applied to
  declare and initialize the loop variable.
- <u>Condition</u>: It is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is
  true, the code inside the loop is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.
- <u>Updation</u>: It is executed at the end of each iteration. It is usually
  used to update or increment the loop variable.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i) // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
}
```

In this example:

- <code>let i = 1</code> initializes the loop variable <code>i</code> to 1.
- <code>i &le; 5</code> is the condition. The loop will continue as long as <code>
    i
  </code> is less than or equal to 5.
- <code>i++</code> increments <code>i</code> by 1 after each iteration.

If the loop body contains only one instruction, you can omit the curly brackets. The updation doesn't necessarily need to be incrementation, but in the vast majority of cases, it is.

```javascript
for (let i = 10; i > 5; i--) console.log(i) // 10, 9, 8, 7, 6

for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i += 5) console.log(i) // 0, 5, 10, 15, 20
```

To create an infinite <code>for</code> loop, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
for (;;) {
  // infinite loop
}
```
## `while` loops
### Basic `while` loop

The <code>while</code> loop is utilized to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is truthy. The basic syntax of the <code>while</code> loop is as follows:

```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

For example:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
}
```

### `do-while` loop

The <code>do-while</code> loop is similar to the <code>while</code> loop, but it guarantees that the code block will be executed at least once before checking the condition.

<Img src={loopMeme} />

The basic syntax of the <code>do-while</code> loop is as follows:

```javascript
do {
  // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

For example:

```javascript
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

In this example, the code inside the <code>do</code> block is executed first, then the condition <code>i < 5</code> is checked. As long as the condition is true, the loop continues to execute.

To create an infinite <code>while</code> loop, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
while (true) {
   // infinite loop
}

do {
   // infinite loop
} while (true);
```

## `break` and `continue`

The <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements are applied to control the flow of loops. They allow you to terminate a loop or skip an iteration based on certain conditions.

### `break`

The <code>break</code> statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a specific condition is met. It can be applied in loops such as <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do-while</code>.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   if (i === 5) break;
   console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

In this example, the loop terminates when the value of <code>i</code> is 5. The <code>break</code> statement stops the loop and the remaining iterations are not executed.

### `continue`

The <code>continue</code> statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next one. It can also be applied in loops such as <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do-while</code>.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   if (i % 2 === 0) continue;
   console.log(i); // 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
}
```

In the above code, the <code>continue</code> statement skips the current iteration when the value of <code>i</code> is even. The loop continues with the next iteration without executing the remaining code within the loop body for that iteration.
When used in nested loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> work only on the loop that they are applied in. If you want to use these statements from the body of an inner loop to affect the behavior of an outer loop, you should use labels.

## Labels

Labels are utilized to name loops or blocks of code, allowing you to use <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements more flexibly. A label is an identifier followed by a colon (<code>:</code>) that appears before a statement or a block of code.

```javascript
labelName: {
  // code block
}
```

### Labels with `break`

You can use a label with the <code>break</code> statement to exit not only the current loop but also any outer loops or code blocks.

```javascript
outerLoop:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
      if (i === 2 && j === 3) break outerLoop;
      console.log('i =', i, 'j =', j);
   }
}
```

The <code>outerLoop</code> label is used with the <code>break</code> statement to exit both loops when <code>i</code> is 2 and <code>j</code> is 3.

### Labels with `continue`

You can also use a label with the <code>continue</code> statement to skip the current iteration of not only the current loop but also any outer loops.

```javascript
outerLoop:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
      if (i === 2 && j === 3)
          continue outerLoop;
      console.log('i =', i, 'j =', j);
   }
}
```

The <code>outerLoop</code> label is used with the <code>continue</code> statement to skip the current iteration of the outer loop when <code>i</code> is 2 and <code>j</code> is 3.

### Labels with blocks

Labels can also be adopted in blocks of code to break out of the block.

```javascript
labelName: {
  console.log('Inside the block');
  break labelName;
  console.log('This will not be executed');
}
```
