It’s time to write your very first JavaScript code! You can do it in many ways. Read about them below and choose your favorite.

## Browser Console

JavaScript, originally designed for browsers, provides a convenient way to execute code through the browser console. This tutorial focuses on Chrome, but the process is similar in other browsers. To get started, open the dev tools by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+I</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Cmd+Option+I</code> (Mac) to launch the Chrome Developer Tools. Then navigate to the *Console* tab. Type <code>console.log('Hello, World!')</code> in the console and press Enter. This will display <code>'Hello, World!'</code> in the console. For multiline scripts, press <code>Shift+Enter</code> to create a line break without executing the code immediately. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through previously entered commands. To clear the console, press <code>Ctrl+L</code> (Windows/Linux) or <code>Cmd+K</code> (Mac).

<Aside type="note">
- There's no difference between **'**single quotes**'** and **"**double quotes**"** in JavaScript. They work exactly the same.
- Semicolons at the end of each line are optional. Whether you use them or not is a matter of personal preference or the coding conventions followed by your team.

## CodePen

While the built-in browser console is excellent for quick testing of short scripts, it may become inconvenient for longer ones. To overcome this limitation without leaving your browser, you can utilize online code editors such as CodePen. You’ll find three tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Open the third one, then type <code>console.log("Hello World")</code> and open the console (bottom left corner). After a short time, you’ll see the output.

## `<script>` tag

Another method to execute JavaScript code involves embedding it within the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in an HTML document.

Create a file with an .html extension and paste the HTML skeleton. If you have Visual Studio Code installed (which I encourage you to do), you can expedite this process by entering an exclamation mark (<code>!</code>) and pressing Tab. This action prompts your IDE to generate the HTML skeleton. Add the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the head section, like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
	<script>
		console.log("Hello, World!")
	</script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, click on your .html file to open it in your default browser. Access the browser console to confirm that your script has been successfully executed.

You can also create a file with a .js extension and link it inside an .html file. To keep it simple, make sure both files are placed in the same folder.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Document</title>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="./app.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// app.js
console.log('Hello from another file');
```

## Node.js

Yet another way to run JS code involves installing Node.js. Node is a popular JavaScript runtime, providing an environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. To initiate this, open a terminal and type <code>node</code>. This command opens the mode called **REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop), allowing you to enter and execute JavaScript code directly in the terminal. This works similarly to the browser console mentioned earlier.

You can also execute complete JavaScript files by specifying the file path after the <code>node</code> command. For example: <code>node my_file.js</code>. This executes the JavaScript code present in the specified file and displays the output in the terminal. This method is particularly beneficial for running more extensive programs. If you use VS Code, you can run JavaScript code using built-in features or extensions. Right-click anywhere in the code editor and select <code>Run Code</code> or use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+Alt+N</code>. This will open a terminal at the bottom of VS Code, displaying the code execution results.

<Aside type="tip">
Although Node.js is commonly adopted as a platform for developing backend applications, it is highly recommended to have it installed even if you are working on frontend apps. This is because Node.js is utilized to manage dependencies through npm (Node Package Manager).
