In the previous chapter, we discussed <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops. It turns out these are not the only one methods to perform iterations. Some data types offer special ways to iterate over them.

## array.map()

The <code>map()</code> method is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array. The basic syntax of the <code>map()</code> method is as follows:

```javascript
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr) {
  // code to be executed
}, thisValue)
```

For example:

```javascript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30]

const doubled = numbers.map((num, index, array) => {
  console.log(index) // 0, 1, 2
  console.log(array) // [10,20,30], [10,20,30], [10,20,30]
  
  return num * 2
})

console.log(doubled) // [20, 40, 60]
```

In this example, the <code>map()</code> method is utilized to double the values in the numbers array. A new array, <code>doubled</code>, is created, containing the results of applying the function to each element in the <code>numbers</code> array. 

The <code>map()</code> method is specifically designed for arrays and cannot be adopted to iterate over other data types directly. However, you can convert other data types, such as strings, maps or sets, into arrays using <code>Array.from()</code> or the spread operator (...) and then apply the <code>map()</code> method.

```javascript
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
const doubledSet = Array.from(set).map(num => num * 2)
console.log(doubledSet) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

<Aside type="note">

<code>map()</code> is often applied in the React library to render lists of components.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### thisValue

The <b>thisValue</b> argument is an optional parameter that allows you to specify what this should refer to when the callback function is executed. It also appears in other array methods like <code>filter()</code> or <code>reduce()</code>. By default it is <code>undefined</code> in strict mode or <code>window/global</code> in non-strict mode. If you want to use it, avoid using arrow functions, as they don't bind <code>this</code> correctly.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

const obj = {
  multiplier: 10,
};

numbers.map(function (num) {
  console.log(num * this.multiplier) // 10, 20, 30
}, obj)
```

If you don't know what is going on with the <code>this</code>, visit the "Execution context" lesson from "Miscellaneous" chapter.

## forEach()

The <code>forEach()</code> method is primarily used to execute a provided function once for each element in an array. It can also be applied to the values of maps and sets. It is a more concise way to iterate over arrays compared to traditional for loops. Syntax:

```javascript
array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr) {
  // code to be executed
}, thisValue)
```

So the syntax is identical to the map() method. For instance, using <code>forEach</code> with an array:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.forEach(function(value) {
  console.log(value) // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
})
```

In this example, the <code>forEach</code> method iterates over each element in the <code>arr</code> array and logs the value to the console.

The <code>forEach</code> method does not return a new array, it simply executes the provided function for each element in the array.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.forEach(function(value, index, array) {
  array[index] = value * 2
})
console.log(arr) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Unlike some other array methods, <code>forEach</code> does not allow for breaking out of the loop early. If you need to stop the iteration based on a condition, you should use a different loop, such as a traditional <code>for</code> loop or a <code>for-of</code> loop.

## for-of Loop

The <code>for-of</code> loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps and sets. It allows you to loop through the values of an iterable without needing to access the keys.

```javascript
// Strings
const str = 'abc'

for (const key of str) {
  console.log(key) // "a", "b", "c"
}

// Arrays
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']

for (const value of arr) {
  console.log(value) // "a", "b", "c"
}

// Maps
const map = new Map([
  [0, 'a'],
  [1, 'b'],
])

for (const entry of map) {
  console.log(entry) // [0, "a"], [1, "b"]
}

// Sets
const set = new Set(['a', 'b'])

for (const key of set) {
  console.log(key) // "a", "b"
}
```

The <code>for-of</code> loop cannot be used to iterate over objects directly. However, with the help of <code>Object.keys()</code>, <code>Object.values()</code>, or <code>Object.entries()</code>, you can achieve similar results. These methods return, respectively, the keys, the values, and an array where the first element is the key and the second is the value.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Jack",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Physician"
}

for (const key of Object.keys(obj)){
  console.log("key: "+ key+ ", value: "+ obj[key])
  // note that obj.key would return undefined
}
/* Output:
  "key: name, value: Jack"
  "key: age, value: 30"
  "key: occupation, value: Physician"
*/

for (const value of Object.values(obj)){
  console.log("value: "+ value)
}
/* Output:
  "value: Jack"
  "value: 30"
  "value: Physician"
*/

for (const entry of Object.entries(obj)){
  console.log(entry)
}
/* Output:
  ["name","Jack"]
  ["age",30]
  ["occupation","Physician"]
*/
```

## for-in Loop

The <code>for-in</code> loop is used while going through the keys of objects, arrays or strings. Maps or sets are not compatible with it.

```javascript
// Strings
const str = "abc"

for(key in str){
  console.log(key, str[key])
}

// Arrays
const arr = ["a", "b", "c"]

for(key in arr){
  console.log(key, arr[key])
}

// Objects
const obj = {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c"}

for(key in obj){
  console.log(key, obj[key])
}

/* Outputs of each loop:
  "0" "a"
  "1" "b"
  "2" "c"
*/
```

As you can see, <code>for-in</code> converts keys into strings.

If you can, you should favor the <code>for-of</code> loop over <code>for-in</code> because the latter also iterates over inherited prototype properties, which can lead to unintended behavior.
