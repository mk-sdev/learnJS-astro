## Primitive and complex types

So far in this app we've used some data types like numbers and strings. They are primitive types which means they have only one property which is a value. We also explored a bit array and objects that are complex types. They may have multiple properties. Here are more examples of data types in JS:

<Img src={dataTypes} />

We can define a variable in two ways. One of them is literal notation, where we directly assign a value to a variable using a literal value. For example, when we declare a string using quotes, we are using literal notation:

```javascript
let name = "John"
let age = 28
let hobbies = ['swimming','programming','singing']

//using a dot we can access properties of a complex type
console.log(hobbies.length) // 3
```

The other way is by using a constructor function:

```javascript
let name = new String('John')
let age = new Number(28)
let hobbies = new Array('swimming','programming','singing')
```

However, this approach is not advisable. The first reason is that it can make the code less readable, and the second reason is that variables created in this way are always of a complex type, which might lead to unexpected behavior.

```javascript
{
  let str1 = 'John'
  let str2 = 'John'

  console.log(str1 === str2) //true
}

{
  let str1 = new String('John')
  let str2 = new String('John')

  console.log(str1 === str2) //false
}
```

By the way, this is why some people are convinced that everything in JavaScript is an object. Now you know this is not true. The second reason why people might think that is that we can invoke certain properties and methods on primitive types, which is typically associated with complex types. For instance:

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3]
console.log(array.length) // We access the 'length' property of an array

let string = "Hello"
console.log(string.length) // We access the 'length' property of a string. But wait... primitive types have only one property which is their value. So why can we have access to another property?
```

The reason why this code works fine is that at the moment of accessing the length property, the string is temporarily converted to an object. This process is known as <b>autoboxing</b>. In JavaScript, primitive values like strings, numbers, and booleans do not inherently possess properties or methods. However, JavaScript can automatically convert these primitives into their corresponding object wrappers (e.g., <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>) when you attempt to access a property or method. 

In other programming languages, such as Python, this mechanism doesn't exist.

```python
str = "Hello"
print(len(str)) # the way of getting a string length in Python
```

## Truthy and falsy

Another important classification of data types involves their behavior in conditional contexts, distinguishing between truthy and falsy values. In JavaScript, any value can be evaluated in a boolean context, such as in conditionals or logical operations. Truthy values are those that evaluate to true when coerced to a boolean, while falsy values evaluate to false. Here are examples of falsy values:

```javascript
// here is an array of falsy values in JS:
const falsyValuesInJs = [
  false, // false boolean
   // 0 number
  0, 
  -0,  // yea
  0n,
  // empty strings
   "",
   '',
   ``,
  NaN, // Not a Number
  undefined,
  null
]
```

There is also '<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/all'>document.all</a>' value which is now archaic so you don't need to bother with it 

The interesting thing about falsy values is that only primitive types can ba falsy.

```javascript
const bool = new Boolean(false)

// 'bool' variable has false value but as it was defined via constructor it is a complex type - therefore it cannot be falsy
if (bool) {
  console.log('bool is truthy') // 'bool is truthy'
}
```

From the group of falsy values we can distinguish another group - <b>nullish</b>. It consists of <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>.

## Type checking

### typeof

Finding out a variable's type in JavaScript may be a tricky task. The most common way to do so is to use <code>typeof</code> keyword:

```javascript
let x = 42
console.log(typeof x) // "number"

let y = 'Hello'
console.log(typeof y) // "string"

let z = true
console.log(typeof z) // "boolean"

let obj = {}
console.log(typeof obj) // "object"

let func = function () {}
console.log(typeof func) // "function"

let arr = []
console.log(typeof arr) // "object" (arrays are objects in JavaScript)

let und
console.log(typeof und) // "undefined"

let n = null
console.log(typeof n) // "object" (this is a quirk in JavaScript)
```

There are some issues with this approach. <code>typeof</code> can be successfully utilized to find out simple types. However, when it comes to complex ones, it is not a good choice as it will almost always return <code>"object"</code>, which in some cases isn't precise enough. The only exception is functions. Yes, in JavaScript, functions are objects.

The other issue is the type of <code>null</code> is object. We know null is a primitive type. How can it be an object then? The reason for this is rooted in JavaScript's history. When JavaScript was first created, values were stored in a format that could encode both the type of the value and the actual data of the value. The type tag for objects was <code>0</code>, and for <code>null</code>, it was <code>0</code> as well, which is why <code>typeof null</code> returns <code>"object"</code>.

### finding out complex types

We can find out if a variable is an array using <code>Array.isArray()</code>.

```javascript
let variable1 = [1, 2, 3]
let variable2 = 123

console.log(Array.isArray(variable1)) //true
console.log(Array.isArray(variable2)) //false
```

Another alternative is the <b>instanceof</b> keyword. It doesn't tell the type directly but checks if an object is an instance of a particular constructor function, which can help determine the specific type of an object. However, it will return true for all objects that inherit from the constructor's prototype.

```javascript
// Define a constructor function
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}

// Create an instance of Person
let person1 = new Person('Alice')

console.log(person1 instanceof Person) // true
console.log(person1 instanceof Object) // true

let date = new Date()
console.log(date instanceof Date) // true
console.log(date instanceof Object) // true
console.log(date instanceof Person) // false

let arr = []
console.log(arr instanceof Array) // true
console.log(arr instanceof Object) // true
console.log(arr instanceof Date) // false
```

## Mutability and reference

Take a look at this code:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3]

arr[2] = 4

console.log(arr) // [1, 2, 4]
```

If you studied the "Declaration keywords" lesson from the previous chapter, this code might seem strange to you. Variables declared with the <code>const</code> keyword can't have their value reassigned. However, in the case of complex variables like arrays, the value of the variable refers to the reference or address of the object in memory, not its contents. This means that while you can't reassign the entire array to a new array or another value, you can still modify the elements within the array. The same applies to objects. For example, you can add, remove, or change elements in an array even if it's declared with the <code>const</code> keyword. In the lesson about variables you learnt the word "variable" means "able to change". This is why we can still refer to data types preceded by <code>const</code> as variables.

<Aside type="tip">

If you want to prevent modifying elements of an object you can use <code>Object.freeze()</code>.

```javascript
const arr = [0, 1]
Object.freeze(arr)
arr[0] = 5
console.log(arr) // [0,1]
```

Alternatively you can use <code>as const</code> but this works only in TypeScript.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3] as const

arr[2] = 4 // Cannot assign to '2' because it is a read-only property.
```

</Aside>

As a consequence of this, if we assign the same object to two or more variables, they will point to the same entity: any change made through one variable will be reflected when accessing the object through the other variables. For instance, if we change a property of the object, this change will be visible in all variables referencing that object.

```javascript
const a = { name: 'Adam' }
const b = a

b.age = 32

console.log(a, b); //{name: 'Adam', age: 32}, {name: 'Adam', age: 32}
```

If we use <code>===</code> to check if two objects are equal we would get false even if both look exactly the same. This is because variables that hold objects store references to the memory location where the object is stored, not the actual object itself. Thus, even if two objects have identical properties and values, they are considered different entities in memory. Think of those identical objects like identical twins; they look the same but are still two different people.

```javascript
const person1 = { name: 'Adam', age: 32 }
const person2 = { name: 'Adam', age: 32 }

console.log(person1 === person2) //false
```
