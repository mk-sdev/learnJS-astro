## Prototypal inheritance

You can compare inheritance in programming to inheritance in real life. Children inherit certain characteristics from their parents. In JavaScript, this concept is implemented using prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

When you create an object (e.g., an array) and then log it to the console, you'll see something strange. In addition to the properties you created there will be a property called <code>[[Prototype]]</code> (in some browsers it is called `__proto__`). This is basically an object that your object inherits from. In our case, the prototype object is the built-in <code>Array</code>.

<Img src={console} />

Every JavaScript object has a prototype, from which it can inherit properties and methods. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the property exists on the object itself. If not, it looks up the <b>prototype chain</b> to see if itâ€™s defined in the object's prototype, and continues searching up the chain until it reaches the root, which is usually <code>Object.prototype</code>.

<hr />

To get an object's prototype, we can use <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> method.

Every class in JavaScript has also a special <code>prototype</code> property. This property is not directly accessible from the instances of the class. In fact, the <code>prototype</code> property of a class is used as the prototype for its instances. When an instance is created, its internal prototype (accessible via <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(instance)</code>) points to the <code>prototype</code> property of the class that created it.

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('The animal makes a sound')
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('The dog barks')
  }
}

// Create an instance of the subclass
const myDog = new Dog()

// Use Object.getPrototypeOf() to get the prototype of the object
const prototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(myDog)

console.log('Prototype of myDog:', prototype)

// Check if the prototype is Dog.prototype
console.log(prototype === Dog.prototype) // true

// Call a method from the prototype
prototype.speak() // Output: The dog barks
```

If you are still struggling to understand the topic, I hope this video clarifies it a bit:

## Class inheritance

Class inheritance allows one class (called the subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called the superclass). In JavaScript, class inheritance is built on top of prototypal inheritance, meaning classes are essentially syntactic sugar over the prototype-based model. This means that even when using classes, objects ultimately inherit from other objects via the prototype chain.

To create a subclass that inherits from a superclass, we apply the <code>extends</code> keyword. The subclass automatically inherits non-private properties and methods of the superclass (see the encapsulation lesson).

```javascript
class Animal {
  age = 10
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise`)
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name) // Calls the constructor of the superclass (Animal)
    this.breed = breed
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks`)
  }
}

const animal = new Animal('Luna')
animal.speak() // Luna makes a noise
const dog = new Dog('Vincent', 'Labrador')
dog.speak() // Vincent barks
console.log(dog.age) // 10 // Dog automatically inherited this property from Animal.
```

### super

Two things may have caught your attention in the above code.

The first thing is the word <code>super</code>. It is used to call methods or the constructor of the parent class in a subclass. This allows the subclass to inherit behavior from its parent class and modify or extend it as needed.

### overriding

The second thing is that the <code>Dog</code> class has a method with the same name as in its superclass, but it behaves differently. This is called method <b>overriding</b>, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method already defined in the parent class.

If we want to override a method while keeping its original logic, there is nothing stopping us from using <code>super</code> in the method of the subclass.

```javascript
class Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log('Animal speaks')
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    super.speak() // Calls the speak method from Animal
    console.log('Dog barks')
  }
}

const dog = new Dog()
dog.speak() // Animal speaks; Dog barks
```

In JavaScript, a subclass can also be a superclass of another class. This means a class can inherit from another and still be inherited by others, forming a chain of inheritance. However, JavaScript supports single inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from only one class at a time. This avoids the complexities associated with multiple inheritance.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`)
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name)
    this.breed = breed
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`)
  }
}

class Puppy extends Dog {
  constructor(name, breed, age) {
    super(name, breed)
    this.age = age
  }
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is a puppy and barks.`)
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">

If you are using TypeScript, you can explicitly indicate that a method in a subclass overrides a method from the superclass by using the <code>override</code> keyword.

```typescript
class Animal {
  speak(): void {
    console.log('Animal makes a sound')
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  override speak(): void {
    // Explicitly overriding the 'speak' method from Animal
    console.log('Dog barks')
  }
}

const dog = new Dog()
dog.speak() // Output: Dog barks
```

The benefits of using the <code>override</code> keyword include:

- <u>Error prevention</u>: TypeScript will throw an error if the method in the
  subclass does not correctly override the method in the superclass (e.g, you
  misspelled its name), helping to catch potential mistakes at compile time.
- <u>Clarity of intent</u>: The use of <code>override</code> makes it clear that
  the method is intended to replace the superclass method, improving code
  readability and maintainability.

Inheritance is not always the best option. Consider using composition instead.
