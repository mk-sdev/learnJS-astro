## What are abstract classes?

Abstract classes are a special type of class that cannot be instantiated directly. Their primary purpose is to serve as a base or blueprint for other classes to inherit from. Abstract classes may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.

- Abstract methods are methods that can only be declared in abstract classes and do not have an implementation (i.e., a body). They serve as placeholders for methods that must be implemented in the closest non-abstract subclasses. This enforces a structure on the child classes, ensuring they implement certain functionality.
- Non-abstract methods in an abstract class are fully implemented methods that can be inherited by child classes. These methods can be overridden, but they do not need to be.

## Abstract classes in JavaScript

JavaScript does not have built-in abstract classes support like other languages such as Java or C#. However, you can simulate them by throwing errors in methods that should be implemented by subclasses.

In the example below, the class <code>Animal</code> is treated like an abstract class. It contains an unimplemented method <code>speak</code>, and attempts to instantiate the <code>Animal</code> class directly will result in an error. The <code>Dog</code> and <code>Cat</code> classes are derived from <code>Animal</code> and each provides its own implementation of the <code>speak</code> method.

```javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    if (new.target === Animal) {
      throw new Error('Cannot instantiate abstract class')
    }
    this.name = name
  }

  speak() {
    throw new Error('Method "speak" must be implemented')
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks`)
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} meows`)
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex')
dog.speak() // Rex barks
const cat = new Cat('Whiskers')
cat.speak() // Whiskers meows

```

This pattern enforces that any subclass of <code>Animal</code> must implement the <code>speak</code> method, otherwise an error will be thrown. This behavior mimics the concept of abstract classes, ensuring that child classes adhere to a particular structure.

### new.target

The <code>new.target</code> is used to detect whether a constructor is called directly or via inheritance. In the example above, <code>new.target === Animal</code> ensures that the <code>Animal</code> class cannot be instantiated directly. If <code>Animal</code> is the target of the <code>new</code> operator (i.e., if it is called directly), an error is thrown, simulating an abstract class.

<Aside type="caution">

<code>new.target</code> doesn't work with arrow functions

## Abstract classes in TypeScript

While JavaScript doesn't directly provide abstraction, TypeScript does. We can achieve this by placing the <code>abstract</code> keyword before the class declaration.

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  abstract getArea(): number
  abstract getPerimeter(): number
  printDetails(): void {
    console.log(
      `Area: ${this.getArea()}, Perimeter: ${this.getPerimeter()}`,
    )
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number
  constructor(radius: number) {
    super()
    this.radius = radius
  }
  getArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2)
  }
  getPerimeter(): number {
    return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(5)
circle.printDetails() 
// "Area: 78.53981633974483, Perimeter: 31.41592653589793"
```

In this example, the abstract class <code>Shape</code> cannot be instantiated directly. It contains abstract methods <code>getArea()</code> and <code>getPerimeter(),</code> which must be implemented in the derived class <code>Circle</code>. The subclass provides concrete implementation of the <code>getArea()</code> and <code>getPerimeter()</code> methods.

The <code>Shape</code> class also has a non-abstract method <code>printDetails(),</code> which is shared by subclasses. This shows how abstract classes can combine both abstract and non-abstract methods, allowing common functionality to be reused while enforcing certain methods to be overridden in subclasses. 



<hr/>

While abstract classes are meant to be inherited, they can also inherit from other classes, both abstract and non-abstract.

```typescript
class BaseClass {
  sayHello(): void {
    console.log('Hello from BaseClass!')
  }
}

abstract class AbstractClass1 extends BaseClass {
  abstract doSomething(): void
}

abstract class AbstractClass2 extends AbstractClass1 {
  abstract anotherAbstractMethod(): void
}

class FinalClass extends AbstractClass2 {
  // must implement all abstract methods from its superclasses

  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something in FinalClass!')
  }

  anotherAbstractMethod(): void {
    console.log('Doing another thing in FinalClass!')
  }
}
```
