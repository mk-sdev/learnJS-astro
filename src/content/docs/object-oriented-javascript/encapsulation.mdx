## What is encapsulation and why is it important?

Many everyday objects have a casing that protects their internal mechanisms and components. This is done not only for aesthetic reasons but also for practical purposes. The casing shields these objects from irresponsible use. After all, we don’t want to allow someone to accidentally damage delicate parts or risk harm by unknowingly tampering with the device’s inner workings. The same applies to objects in programming. In order to protect them, we use encapsulation to hide their internal data and functions, allowing controlled access through specific methods. This prevents unintended modifications and keeps the object’s internal state secure, ensuring it’s used only in intended ways.

For example, consider a class <code>BankAccount</code> that stores the account balance. By default, <code>balance</code> is public, meaning anyone can change it freely, potentially leading to incorrect or unsafe values.

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  balance // public field

  constructor(balance) {
    this.balance = balance // lack of encapsulation, public field
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount(1000)
console.log(account.balance) // 1000

// Anyone can change the balance directly
account.balance = -500 // Setting an invalid value
console.log(account.balance) // -500
```

## # symbol

To mark a property as private (accessible only within the scope of the class itself), we can simply add the <code>#</code> symbol at the beginning of its name.

```javascript
class Example {
  #privateField = 10
  #privateMethod() {
    console.log('secret')
  }
}

const example = new Example()
// console.log(example.#privateField); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#privateField' must be declared in an enclosing class
example.#privateMethod() // Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#privateMethod' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

<Aside type="note">

In the past, to mark a class member as private, a leading underscore (<code>_</code>) was often used in its name. However, this was purely informational and did not affect functionality, unlike the <code>#</code> syntax, which enforces actual privacy.

## Access modifiers

The <code>private</code> modifier works similarly to the <code>#</code> symbol mentioned earlier. It restricts access to a class member so it can only be accessed within the class itself. The <code>protected</code> modifier allows access within the class and its subclasses but not outside of them.

```typescript
class Example {
    private privateField = 10
    private privateMethod() {
      console.log('secret')

  }
}
const example = new Example()
console.log(example.privateField); // Property 'privateField' is private and only accessible within class 'Example'
example.privateMethod() // Property 'privateMethod' is private and only accessible within class 'Example'
```

While private members can only be called within the class that defines them; protected members allow a subclass to inherit and use those members in its own methods. This makes protected helpful for creating a base class with shared functionality for its derived classes. If you attempt to access <code>protected</code> members outside of their intended scope, TypeScript will throw a compile-time error just as with <code>private</code> members. This ensures better data hiding and security for sensitive or implementation-specific details of a class.

```typescript
class Example {
  protected protectedField = 10
  protected protectedMethod() {
    console.log('secret')
  }
}

class SubClassExample extends Example {
  getProtectedData(){
    console.log(this.protectedField) // accessible in the subclass
    this.protectedMethod() // accessible in the subclass
  }
}

const example = new Example()
console.log(example.protectedField) // Error
example.protectedMethod() // Error
```

<Aside type="note">

In TypeScript there is also the <code>public</code> modifier. It ensures that class properties and methods are accessible from anywhere—inside the class, its instances, and outside the class—which is the default behavior in TypeScript and JavaScript.

## Setters and getters

While the <code>#</code> symbol is effective at preventing direct access to a method or property, what if we want them to remain accessible but in a more controlled and structured manner? For this purpose we create special methods that handle these tasks.

```javascript
class Person {
  #age // private field

  constructor(age) {
    this.#age = age > 0 ? age : 0 // set initial age, or 0 if invalid
  }

  // Getter for age
  getAge() {
    return this.#age
  }

  // Setter for age with validation
  setAge(value) {
    if (value > 0) {
      this.#age = value
    } else {
      console.error('Age must be a positive number.')
    }
  }
}

const person = new Person(25)
console.log(person.getAge()) // 25 - calls the getAge method

person.setAge(30) // Calls the setAge method
console.log(person.getAge()) // 30

person.setAge(-5) // Attempt to set an invalid value, triggers an error
console.log(person.getAge()) // 30 - value remains unchanged
```

### set and get

Thanks to <code>get</code> and <code>set</code>, we can access an object's properties as if they were regular fields, while still maintaining control over how they are accessed and modified.

```javascript
class Person {
  #age // private field

  constructor(age) {
    this.#age = age > 0 ? age : 0 // set age to 0 if the given value is invalid
  }

  // Getter for age
  get age() {
    return this.#age
  }

  // Setter for age with validation
  set age(value) {
    if (value > 0) {
      this.#age = value
    } else {
      console.error('Age must be a positive number.')
    }
  }
}

const person = new Person(25)
console.log(person.age) // 25 - invokes the getter

person.age = 30 // Invokes the setter
console.log(person.age) // 30

person.age = -5 // Attempt to set an invalid value, triggers an error
console.log(person.age) // 30 - value remains unchanged
```

## Module-based encapsulation

Module-based encapsulation refers to the practice of organizing code into independent, reusable modules that expose a controlled interface, while hiding the internal details and logic from the outside. This approach helps to prevent direct access to an object's internal state, ensuring that only specific functionality is exposed to other parts of the application. 

In JavaScript, module-based encapsulation is often achieved through various patterns and techniques, including ES6 Modules, Immediately Invoked Function Expressions, and CommonJS Modules (Node.js). Here I'll focus on an example of ES6 Modules. 

Consider a file <code>counter.js</code> which is a standalone module:

```javascript
// file: counter.js (Module)
let count = 0 // private variable

// Expose only the functions that are needed
export function increment() {
  count++
}

export function getCount() {
  return count
}

// Internal function, not exposed
function reset() {
  count = 0
}
```

Now we import it in another file:

```javascript
// file: app.js
import { getCount, increment } from './counter.js'

increment()
console.log(getCount()) // 1
```

<code>count</code> is encapsulated within the <code>counter.js</code> module and cannot be accessed directly from <code>app.js</code>. Only the <code>increment()</code> and <code>getCount()</code> functions are exposed for interaction.

## Nested scopes

Encapsulation through nested scopes involves creating inner scopes that are enclosed within outer scopes. This allows certain variables and functions to be hidden from the global scope or other parts of the code, ensuring that they can only be accessed or modified in specific contexts. This allows you to create private variables and internal functions that are not directly accessible from the outside, thereby protecting the internal state and reducing the risk of unintended modifications.

```javascript
function createCounter(initialValue) {
  let count = initialValue // private variable

  // Method to increment the count
  function increment() {
    count++
    console.log(`Current count: ${count}`)
  }

  // Return an object with a property (getCount) and method (increment)
  return {
    getCount: function () {
      return count
    },
    increment,
  }
}

const counter = createCounter(5)
console.log(counter.getCount()) // 5 - Access the private variable via getter
counter.increment() // Current count: 6 - Increment the count
console.log(counter.getCount()) // 6 - Access the updated count
console.log(count) // Uncaught ReferenceError: count is not defined
```

It works similarly to the concept of closures introduced in one of the previous chapters.
