Utility types are built-in types based on generics that allow you to transform and manipulate types. They help reduce code duplication and enhance type safety by providing various ways to create new types based on existing ones. These utility types are especially useful when working with complex objects, making your TypeScript code more flexible and maintainable.

## `Partial<Type>`

The `Partial` utility type makes all properties of a type optional. This is useful when you only need to update or provide some fields of an object, rather than all fields.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
}

const user: Partial<User> = {
  name: 'John',
}
```

## `Required<Type>`

The `Required` utility type makes all properties of a type required. If any property in the original type was optional, it will no longer be so.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number
  name?: string // this property is optional
}

const newUser: Required<User> = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice', // 'name' is now required
}
```

## `Readonly<Type>`

The `Readonly` utility type makes all properties of a type immutable, preventing them from being changed after assignment.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number
  name: string
}

const user: Readonly<User> = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Alice',
}

user.name = 'Bob' // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property
```

## `Record<Keys, Type>`

The `Record` utility type constructs a type with a set of properties Keys of type Type. This is useful for creating types that represent objects with dynamic keys.

```typescript
type Role = 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest'
const rolePermissions: Record<Role, string> = {
  admin: 'all',
  user: 'restricted',
  guest: 'read-only',
}
```

## `Pick<Type, Keys>`

The `Pick` utility type creates a new type by selecting a subset of properties (Keys) from an existing type.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
  email: string
}

type UserPreview = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>

const user: UserPreview = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John',
}
```

## `Omit<Type, Keys>`

The `Omit` utility type creates a new type by excluding certain properties (Keys) from an existing type. This is the opposite of Pick.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
  email: string
}

type UserWithoutEmail = Omit<User, 'email'>

const user: UserWithoutEmail = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
}
```

## `Exclude<UnionType, ExcludedMembers>`

The `Exclude` utility type constructs a new type by removing types from a union.

```typescript
type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'loading'
type ExcludeError = Exclude<Status, 'error'> // "success" | "loading"
```

## `Extract<UnionType, IncludedMembers>`

The `Extract` utility type constructs a type by extracting types from a union that match a specific type.

```typescript
type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'loading'
type OnlyError = Extract<Status, 'loading'> // "loading"
```

## `NonNullable<Type>`

The `NonNullable` utility type removes null and undefined from a type.

```typescript
type UserID = string | null | undefined
type ValidUserID = NonNullable<UserID> // string
```

## `ReturnType<Type>`

The `ReturnType` utility type extracts the return type of a function.

```typescript
function getUser() {
  return { id: 1, name: 'John' }
}

type UserType = ReturnType<typeof getUser> // { id: number; name: string; }
```

## `Awaited<Type>`

The `Awaited` utility type extracts the type of the value that a Promise resolves to. It simplifies working with asynchronous code by providing the type of the resolved value of a Promise, allowing you to handle the underlying type more effectively.

```typescript
type FetchDataReturnType = Awaited<Promise<number>>

// Usage example:
async function fetchData(): Promise<number> {
  return 42
}

type Result = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof fetchData>>; // number
```

## `InstanceType<Type>`

The `InstanceType` utility type extracts the instance type of a constructor function (i.e., the type of an object created by the class or constructor function).

```typescript
class User {
  constructor(
    public id: number,
    public name: string,
  ) {}
}

type UserInstance = InstanceType<typeof User> // User
```
