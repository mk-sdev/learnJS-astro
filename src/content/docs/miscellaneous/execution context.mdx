The execution context in JavaScript is an abstract concept that represents the environment in which code is executed. It contains everything necessary to execute a piece of code, including the variables, the `this` keyword, the outer environment reference, and the code currently being executed.

## `this` keyword

`this` tells the context.

When we run code outside of any function, the context is the global object, which is `window` in browsers and `global` in Node.js.

```javascript
console.log(this); // window
```

If code is run inside an object method, ``this` refers to the object the method belongs to.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet() {
    console.log(this.name); // 'Alice'
  }
};
obj.greet();
```

If a method is defined inside a nested object, `this` refers to the nearest object the method is called on.

```javascript
const outerObj = {
  innerObj: {
    name: 'Bob',
    greet() {
      console.log(this.name); // 'Bob'
    }
  }
};
outerObj.innerObj.greet();
```

For arrow functions, `this` is determined by the surrounding (lexical) scope at the time of the function's creation. Arrow functions do not have their own `this`, so they inherit it from the outer context.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'Charlie',
  greet: () => {
    console.log(this); // window/global
  }
}

obj.greet();
```

For regular functions, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. Normally, `this` in functions refers to the global object when called in a non-method context.

```javascript
function init() {
  console.log(this); // window (or global in Node.js)
}
init();
```

However, in strict mode, `this` is `undefined` in standalone functions.

```javascript
'use strict'

function init() {
  console.log(this); // undefined
}
init();
```

When a function is defined within an object but not as a method, it still behaves like a standalone function. If such a function is called without an object context, `this` will refer to the global object in non-strict mode, or `undefined` in strict mode.

```javascript
const obj = {
  age: 120,
  show: function() {
    console.log(this); // Points to obj
  },
  innerFunc: function() {
    function notAMethod() {
      console.log(this); // window (or global in Node.js) in non-strict mode, undefined in strict mode
    }
    notAMethod();
  }
};
obj.show();
obj.innerFunc();
```

## apply(), call(), bind()

The `apply`, `call`, and `bind` methods are used to manipulate the context. These methods are particularly useful when you want to borrow methods from other objects or control the execution context of a function.

### apply()

The `apply()` method calls a function with a given `this` value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object). This allows you to pass arguments to a function in a flexible way, especially useful when the number of arguments is not known beforehand.

<Aside type="tip">

You can use a mnemonic to remember that `apply()` takes an array of arguments because both "apply" and "array" start with the same letter.

</Aside>

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Alice' };

function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name + punctuation);
}

greet.apply(person, ['Hello', '!']); // Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### call()

The `call()` method also calls a function with a given `this` value, but arguments are provided individually. This method is useful when you know the exact number and order of arguments you need to pass.

```javascript
const person = { name: 'Bob' };

function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name + punctuation);
}

greet.call(person, 'Hi', '.'); // Output: Hi, Bob.
```

### bind()

The `bind()` method creates a new function (called in JS jargon a 'bound function') that, when called, has its `this` set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. This method is particularly useful for setting the context in event handlers or callbacks.

```javascript
const person = {name: 'Nick'}

function greet(greeting, punctuation){
  console.log(greeting + ', '+ this.name + punctuation)
}

const boundGreet = greet.bind(person, 'Hey', '!')
boundGreet() //Output: Hey, Nick!

//We don't have to pass the other arguments to the bind()
const boundGreetWithoutArgs = greet.bind(person)
//We can do it at the moment of calling the bound function
boundGreetWithoutArgs('Hi', '?') //Output: Hi, Nick?
```

In summary, `apply()` is suitable for arguments as an array, `call()` for individual arguments, and `bind()` for creating a new function with a preset `this` value. Notice, normally the greet function has a global context but thanks to these three special functions we changed its context to another object for a moment.
