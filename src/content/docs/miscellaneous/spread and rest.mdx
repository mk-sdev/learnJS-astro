Spread and rest operators are two important features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). Both of these features adopt the `...` (three dots) syntax, but they serve different purposes depending on the context in which they are used.

## Spread operator

The spread operator (aka spread syntax) is used to "spread" or expand elements of an iterable (such as an array, string, or object) into individual elements or key-value pairs. It is often used for making shallow copies of arrays or objects, merging arrays or objects, and passing arrays as arguments to functions.

<b>Usage in strings</b>: Thanks to spread operator we can split a string into individual characters.

```javascript
let str = "Lorem ipsum"
console.log(...str) // "L" "o" "r" "e" "m" " " "i" "p" "s" "u" "m"
```

<b>Usage in arrays</b>: The spread operator can be used to spread the elements of an array into a new array or into function arguments.

```javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6]

const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2] // Merging two arrays
console.log(combinedArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

const newArray = [...arr1] // Creating a shallow copy of an array
console.log(newArray) // [1, 2, 3]
```

<b>Usage in objects</b>: Spread operator can also be used to copy or merge objects. This is useful when you want to create a shallow copy of an object or combine multiple objects.

```javascript
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 }
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 }

const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 } // Merging two objects
console.log(mergedObject) // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }

const copiedObject = { ...obj1 } // Creating a shallow copy of an object
console.log(copiedObject) // { a: 1, b: 2 }
```

Splitting objects into smaller parts works differently than splitting arrays.

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3]
const obj = { 0: 'Hello', 1: 'World' }

console.log(...arr) // 1 2 3
console.log(...obj) // Uncaught TypeError: Spread syntax requires ...iterable[Symbol.iterator] to be a function
```

To overcome this issue, use `Objects.values(obj)`:

```javascript
const obj = { 0: 'Hello', 1: 'World' }

console.log(...Object.values(obj)) // 'Hello' 'World'
```

<hr/>

The spread syntax comes in handy while passing arguments to a function.

```javascript
function sum(x, y, z) {
  console.log(x + y + z)
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

// traditional approach:
sum(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2])
// with spread syntax:
sum(...numbers)
```

## Rest operator

Rest operator is used to collect all remaining (or "rest") arguments into an array. This is useful when a function takes a variable number of arguments. It allows you to capture multiple arguments into a single array.

Rest operator is also denoted by the `...` syntax, but the key difference is that spread operator is used in other contexts (arrays, objects, function calls), whereas rest operator is used in function parameter lists. Such a parameter is called the rest parameter

```javascript
function sumAll(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0)
}

console.log(sumAll(1, 2, 3, 4)) // 10
console.log(sumAll(5, 10)) // 15
```

In the sumAll function, the rest parameter `...numbers` captures all arguments passed into the function as an array. Inside the function, we can manipulate this array, in this case using reduce to sum up all the values.

The rest parameter doesn't have to be the only argument of a function, but it always must be the last one.

```javascript
function exampleFunction(firstParam, ...restParams) {
  console.log(firstParam) // 1
  console.log(restParams) // [2, 3, 4]
}

exampleFunction(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

<hr/>

In summary, these two features share similar syntax, but behave in completely different ways. Spread operator splits iterables into smaller parts, whereas rest operator collects values into an array.
